| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`

| `409 Not Found`

| `500 Internal server error`
| Any Unhandled
|===

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

[source,http,options="nowrap"]
----
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 62

[ {
  "field" : "fieldName",
  "message" : "Error message"
} ]
